# Newest update:

Update 0.5.0: Now using Commando Framework, removed lots of commands, added commando's default ones as well as reply and embed commands, working on porting old commands to commando :D

NOTE: My PC is currently broken, I am working on getting it fixed but in the meantime, Pixel will recieve no updates.
